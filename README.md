# nukicius.github.io
this is nukesbrainload. it was started in 2022, in order to replace my first website from 2020. it contains a little introduction to me, nuke, a gallery with some of my art that i like to show, and a blog, which utilizes individual HTML pages. more things are coming to the website though. if you would like to suggest anything, id be glad to hear from you!
## new things coming soon
- [*] redesign the entire website!!
- [*] make website mobile-friendly
- [*] add socials (like discord, last.fm, youtube etc.) to pages about me
- [ ] *perhaps* add a tiny forum/chat/something :3
