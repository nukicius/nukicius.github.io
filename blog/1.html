    <h3>8th May 2022: My first ever blog page!</h3>
    <p>this is my first ever blog page! say hello, everybody. im gonna be posting here for a while, sharing my opinions on crap and its mostly just gonna be me rambling about things or maybe talking about my day, and whatever.</p>
    <p>i really hope that you have a nice day with me! i certainly am, having mostly finished the code for my blog (even tho it gave me like 2 headaches).</p>
    <p>just some notes on the journey, im not gonna use proper grammar for my blog posts (as you can tell), and this may become inactive, so you may see the date at the top become inconsistent, meaning its not really gonna be daily or whatever.</p>
    <p>anyhow, i hope you enjoy this blog, but thats about it for now. have a nice day!</p>
