    <h3>9th May 2022: AUTISM MOMENT</h3>
    <p>second blog post moment, anyway. hello, user. in no way do i want to make this a personality type, but im autistic. i got diagnosed with aspergers in 3rd grade!</p>
    <p>its really not that big of a deal, but i wanna share with you some of the things i have experienced with it, and tell you what its like with it.</p>
    <p>first of all. im not very much like this anymore, but i used to be a big ass crybaby up until 5th grade. i was a goddamn snowflake and if i would stutter 10 times in one sentence, then i would cry. it was embarassing, but i really couldnt help it at all LOL i also thought that "autism is bad and evil and scary!!!" but i have since learned that thats not remotely it, its really basically just "brain different, brain special".</p>
    <p>second of all, i have noticed that for some reason, neurodivergent people (INCLUDING ME) are interested in sam and max??? like ive been in the community for a while and finding a neurotypical person in the community is very rare. i dont think ive even met a single one. welll maybe one, but thats probably about it. i think the reason for that is because the humor in sam and max is pretty weird and only appeals to us. like have you ever heard of that one copypasta? the one that goes "tO bE fAir, yOU HAve to HaVe a VerY hIgh Iq to unDerSTand SAm & MAx. ThE HUmor is exTRemely sUbtl-" okay stfu copypasta. anyway, i think that might have a bit of truth in it. we people can notice the humor better than normal people can, and i find that interesting.</p>
    <p>third of all, idk why, but in a general sense, im pretty mature. well obviously im not really mature in the humor side of things, i just sound like an 8 year old when i make jokes. but i mean like, i feel like an adult, or at least a late teenager, even tho im only 13 lmfao. its just such a weird feeling, especially when im home alone and i gotta make myself some breakfast. i get up, go to the kitchen, toast some bread and make some tea, put some cheese in between the toast and voila. a nice breakfast. and those moments where i do it all by myself, quietly, without any disturbance, it just really makes me feel like im a grown up guy. okay crap sorry i went on a ramble. point is, im pretty mature, and that might be because im autistic or something.</p>
    <p>last one before i talk about how its like to be autistic: INTROVERCY!! WOO!! now i know, i know. introvercy isnt an autistic thing!!! its common across normal people too! but hear me out here. its way more common to be an introvert if ur autistic, from what ive seen, and there are extroverted autists, but they are kinda rare, ngl. most of us are just gonna stand still while the break is going, and we dont talk to others very much, and yeah. we might often get called "the quiet kid". HOWEVERRR,, online, i do socialize alot. irl, i just cant find the confidence to, but online, YEAH. it makes me feel better that they cant see my face and i cant get harmed, and we can just chat and have a good time! hey, maybe even voice chat! with long time friends, im actually comfortable with voice chatting. i used to call myself an ambivert but that doesnt really make sense, so i just call myself either a normal introvert or a social introvert (yes social introverts exist, ive heard the term). idk which term to pick, i just say im both. point is, im an unsocial introvert irl, im a social introvert online and it makes me happy.</p>
    <p>okay NOW TIME FOR THE BIG PART! what is it like to have autism. well, i just feel like im a normal person. i do my routines, i go to school, i do whatever, and autism isnt really that big of a part in my life, it just has made a few things different, for example, sensory, which is a bit more sensitive and in turn can induce sensory overload if stuff is too loud. but other than those few things that are different, i feel like me. im not "nuke with autism", im just, nuke. and it makes me happy that i feel that way, because that means that im okay with the disorder and still enjoy my life with it. its not a bad thing, it just makes me different.</p>
    <p>i hope you enjoyed this blog post, ill see you next time. bye!!! :D</p>
