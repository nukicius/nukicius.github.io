    <h3>27th July 2023: damn.</h3>
    <p>this is my third blog post, and now im 14 lmfao</p>
    <p>it has been OVER A YEAR since my last blog post, and obviously tons of shit has changed. im simply back at this website because i found out how to host the website again (with infinityfree oh wow.)</p>
    <p>some quick changes from the last blog post: my symptoms have improved alot. now i dont even feel like i have autism lmfao this shit just feels like ADHD</p>
    <p>and while im obviously still an introvert, i have more energy for that type of stuff now, and im also way more social both irl and online</p>
    <p>there was also the situation with the whole FRIIIENDSS but i wont get into that. i dont wanna turn this into a vent LOL (and besides, i was able to get some of my buds back. thankfully.)</p>
    <p>tbh i dont know what else to type here, i guess im just cooler now?? well yeah. blog is back.</p>
