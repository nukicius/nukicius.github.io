    <h3>28th July 2023: im such a music nerd lol (+ lil upcoming update to the blog code soon.)</h3>
    <p>hey. first of all, im just gonna say real quick, that im gonna change the code of the blog soon.
      <br>currently, the way its designed is that it takes a txt file from the blog folder i have, and displays the text content on the webpage.
      <br>but this is sort of limiting, considering the fact that you will not be able to embed pictures or whatever this way. so for example, if i make some sort of artsy blog post, ill have to put my image in a link, which is annoying LOL
      <br>so yeah. so far, i think i could fix that by switching to a different file format, like maybe pdf or rtf. but im not sure right now..</p>
    <p>UPDATE FROM 29TH JULY 2023
      <br>i finished the code 
      <br>i ultimately decided to just turn the blog posts into html pages that show up inside of the blog page. and yeah it works really well! great customizability :P
      <br>so now youre seeing the html version of this blog post, with an image, a header, and a bunch of hyperlinks. :3</p>
    <p>ANYWAY THE MAIN TOPIC OF THE DAMN POST. IM A HUGE FUCKING MUSIC NERD. and also a huge nerd in many things but FORGET IT WERE TALKING ABOUT MUSIC RN
      <br>ever since i was a kid, music has intrigued me. when i was 8, i started going to music school to learn the acoustic guitar (which i still do today, and i actually finished my 5th year this month, and got a 1 which is basically 10/10 YAAAAAYAYYAYAY)
      <br>and when i was 9, i got a yamaha ypt-240, a keyboard, for my birthday. which i learned a couple of songs on, but soon i want to get a smaller midi keyboard because its a BIG BOY
      <br>but yeah, point is: i was a music lover ever since i was a teeny tiny boy...
      <br>and that love has grown so damn much over the years!!!!!!!
      <br>when i grew older and older, i listened to tons of video game OSTs, vaporwave, and etc. i actually found something on my scratch profile, and i guess this shows *SOME* of the stuff i listened to when i was younger:</p>

    <p>which is interesting lmao
      <br>considering i listened to some vaporwave shit, i definitely had some alright music taste back then lmao
      <br>but i feel like that sorta stuff definitely influenced my music taste that i have nowadays, as vaporwave tends to sample a variety of 80s songs which are TOTAL. BANGERS.</p>
    <p>speaking bout that. i feel we should probably talk next about my music taste that i actually have now.
      <br>what was rooted from my early music taste, is simply vaporwave, 80s pop, jazz, neosoul, chiptune (I LOVE FEAROFDARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).
      <br>but some other things are simply rap,,,,,, i dont fucking know. LOL
      <br>but yeah recently i have been really getting into tyler the creator, fearofdark, and stuff like that. because i feel like artists like them just make beautiful shit that make me wanna BUS-
      <br>and artists like this really inspire me to actually make my own music. speaking of which:</p>
    <p>yeah. i want to make my own music. and i already kinda am lmao
      <br>for a very very long time, i have REALLY envisioned myself making music. just making music that feels incredibly nice, is pretty damn musical, has the silliest musical methods...
      <br>man. i want to be a producer.
      <br>and im already working on that!!!!
      <br>back in august 2022, i actually made my first ever song (<a href="https://youtu.be/Mez9iQz-h2g" target="_blank">Quick Battle</a>). it wasnt very good, but it was a first :P
      <br>i created this song in LMMS with meowsynth lmfao
      <br>it just goes to show that i was willing to experiment with music production, even if it was pretty janky lol
      <br>and yeah some time went by, i was just existing for a while.
      <br>in that time, i was always trying FL studio a bit out. i was trying to get familiar with it, and try to do some stuff with it.
      <br>one of those things i was trying was recreating a gran turismo 4 song. i never finished it because it once corrupted and shit, and i was just too tired to get it all done.
      <br>but it did show me the basics of what i was doing, and you can take a peek of what it was with a video i sent somewhere as a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/JeSqVrcSoEs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/JeSqVrcSoEs</a>
      <br>and yeah. soon enough, i was actually ready to start making my first song in FL studio.
      <br>i did some work, i did some cool chords, and i tried some new things, and eventually i came up with my first song thats ACTUALLY OKAY. and also at this point in time my latest song
      <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwW05oDKzrY" target="_blank">ridealong :3</a>
      <br>and yeah its alright. still looking forward to improving TONS from this though. im trying new plugins out, thinking of new ways to set shit up, etc etc
      <br>and im having fun. i love having this as a hobbyyyyyyy!!!!</p>
    <p>so yeah im a big music nerd. have had pretty interesting evolution.
      <br>hehe</p>
