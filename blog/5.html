    <p>what a goofball :3
      <br>anyway, the theme of these posts have just been me being all show-offy about my interests. so
    </p>
    <h2>TECH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
    <p>ever since i was a little itty bitty boy i was such a stupid tech nerd. and i showed it in many ways
      <br>when i was like, 9, i was already starting to get interested in stuff like coding (i started with vbs ðŸ’€), and virtualization (i had SO many vms bro)
      <br>and how this came to be was just, the shit i watched
      <br>back when i was like 6 or whatever i was able to watch some random youtube stuff (not unrestricted of course.), and some stuff that really fascinated me was stuff like the wii u, osfirsttimer and UBUNTU
      <br>there was this one video that i found, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N9xqN8Cf5Q" target="_blank">ubuntu crazy error.</a> and something that, as a kid, really made me interested in this was simply how it looked
      <br>i LOVED ubuntu 10.04's aesthetic. i thought the wallpaper was beautiful, the windows were a cool aesthetic, etc. <a href="../images/ubuntu1004thingy.png" target="_blank">(in late 2022 i actually made my 2012 laptop look like it)</a>
      <br>and yeah, i watched a whole bunch of tech stuff from then on. im pretty sure i watched a little LGR too actually :P
      <br>something that also contributed to my tech interest, was my uncle, i guess. he was a gamer and he once showed me how to replace the power supply in my PC. it was dead so he showed me how to switch it (we put in the corsair vs450), and he also showed me how to clean a PC of its dust.
      <br>he also gave me a whole DVD case of games, including fallout 3 LOOL
      <br>so yeah he deffo contributed to it.
    </p>
    <p>some stuff that i did later on was, well, a whole bunch of coding lmao
      <br>ive experimented a bunch with stuff, but i made a bunch of vbs stuff, python stuff, node.js stuff, i even made another website!
    </p>

    <p>i cant remember much i made a while back though. sooooooooooooo</p>
    <p>how is my tech addiction today?
      <br>yeah. its grown :3
      <br>first of all, since early 2022, i started diving a bit into linux. i did some things with customization, i learned a bunch of shit about it, and i actually liked it alot and preferred it over windows.
      <br>today, i use arch linux with KDE plasma. my desktop looks like this:

    <p>YES im a oneshot fan :3
      <br>and ive also done a whole bunch of hardware stuff. first of all, i have actually fixed my g502 hero, which was my first ever repair. the cable was broken, and i had to replace it.
      <br>BUT THE FUCKING CABLE BROKE AGAIN so i gave up and got a steelseries rival 3 wireless lol
      <br>the second time i had to go into the guts of something, was with my ASUS laptop.
      <br>one day, i was simply existing and then BAM the intel optane SSD fucking died ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
      <br>so i ordered a 1 TB crucial p3 plus. and i dove in
    </p>

    <p>it was fucking disgusting
      <br>so much fucking dust.
      <br>but i fixed it and it gave me a bunch of insight on tech
      <br>and i may as well say this real quick, ive also taken apart my old pc a bunch of times by myself.
      <br>lastly, soon ill be building a 600 euro PC, with an amd ryzen 5 5500, amd radeon rx 6600, 16 gb ram, and yuh.
      <br>itll be cool
      <br>dont have much more to say so YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
