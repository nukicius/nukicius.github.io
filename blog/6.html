    <h3>12th September 2023: tiny update on the website!</h3>
    <p>hey. thisll be quick.
      <br>ive been wanting to work on this website more these days, as its a lil passion and i like to keep it nice and dandy. youve probably noticed that i made some changes a little bit ago (like seperating the home and about page!)
      <br>theres also some plans that i have on the github repo of this website. i have some enhancement issues listed that i created for myself. you can check them out :P
      <br>but yeahh this website might stay still for a while, and already has been.
      <br>reason: school >:(
      <br>IVE BEEN REALLY <s>BUSSY</s> BUSY THESE DAYS AND BEEN GETTING TONS OF TESTS AND HOMEWORK AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
      <br>and yeah. i wanna work on this website more but i just been getting hit hard ðŸ˜­
    </p>
    <p>thats all, i just wanted to give yall some info about the state of the website. OBVIOUSLY not gonna die itll simply be hosted on github like usual, but development will be halted.
