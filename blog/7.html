    <h3>23rd May 2024: WEBSITE REDESIGN WOOOOO!!!</h3>
    <p>HEY GUYS. todays a good day because i finally stopped being such a fucking procrastinator and finished my website redesign!! im gonna tell you guys all about it cuz its cool (and also update yall on how ive been cuz why not) :))</p>
    <p>okay so first of all,,,, WHATS NEW?
    <br>tons. by that i mean TONS. let me explain!!!
    </p>
    <h4>the homepage,,,</h4>
    <p>the homepage has had the BIGGEST change, and thats really due to me wanting to use this website as an introduction to myself. heres a comparison of the old homepage + about page versus the new homepage as of now:</p>
    <img src="../images/comparisonofhomepage.png" width="512" height="512" style="border: 2px solid #daad00;">
    <p>as you can tell, i firstly have a new design language for the entire website, a moreso dark tinted black+yellow palette. i came up with this kinda look when i was making my <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nukicius/photo/7318813429001620769" target="_blank">former intro on tiktok</a>!
    <br>its based off a poster for one of tame impala's old tours, the skeleton tiger tour from 2009</p>
    <img src="../images/skeletontigertour.jpg" width="283" height="400" style="border: 2px solid #daad00;">
    <p>its got the same yellowish black as the background, but i went with a darker tone for the actual accent color of the website!</p>
    <p>second of all, one of my biggest gripes about the website has been solved. i made it <b>MOBILE FRIENDLYY!!</b>
    <br>as you can see in the comparison, ive displayed the mobile versions of the old and new homepage, and its frankly pretty easy to tell what improvements have been made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>everything scales up to the complete size of the phone so that stuffs easy to read and whatever</li>
        <li>the header is centered so that it doesnt look like complete dogshit on mobile</li>
        <li>all of the buttons are now much easier to press on mobile!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>all in all, the website is actually, well, usable on mobile now. im very glad that i got that out of the way!!
    <br>third of all, i added a new page to the website :P</p>
    <h4>the gallery,,,</h4>
    <p>im now also gonna start using the website to show some of my art, some art of my stuff from people i know and other shit like that!! theres already a BUNCH of stuff in it which i would love for you to check out. its really just a little photodump, ya know</p>
    <p>so yuh!! thats about it for the website, overall its got a VERY DIFFERENT new look which is sleek, it now explains me and itself VERY well with the homepage, it works for mobile devices correctly and it hosts some cool images!!!</p>
    <p>now ME! its been 8 months since the last blog posts so shit has CHANGEDDD. lemme tell ya!
      <br>so first of all I TURNED 15!! my birthday was on the 23rd march (exactly 2 months before today lmao) and it was cool to say the least, i got my own vinyl player (audiotechnica LP-60X) and 5 albums on vinyl!!! check this out</p>
    <img src="../images/vinyl.png" width="700" height="500" style="border: 2px solid #daad00;">
    <img src="../images/allvinylihave.png" width="700" height="500" style="border: 2px solid #daad00;">
    <p>its RAAAAAAADDDD
    <br>second of all i have actually been really happy in general recently, mostly due to the fact that ive found someone i love very dearly. i love you samber!!! :3
    <br>third of all i got this 2002 laptop which is really cool it runs windows xp its got 256 mb ram and its fucking sick
    <br>fourth of all i MAY OR MAY NOT get into tracker music,,,,, i find mod trackers so fucking interesting and cool OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDD id loveto be able to make my own, ive already started trying a bit im just not really good at that typa shit yk LMFAO
